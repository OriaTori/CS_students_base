[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/OriaTori/CS_students_base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/OriaTori/CS_students_base) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/57487a6bd00d48ed8ab1d2fc4d966e2b)](https://www.codacy.com/app/OriaTori/CS_students_base?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=OriaTori/CS_students_base&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## In groups of 2-3 people, write a program that will store data about students

Requirements:

-   [x] Building system (preferably CMake, optional Makefile)
-   [x] Storage of the records with the structure: Name, surname, index number.
-   [ ] Adding new data
-   [ ] Sorting by index number
-   [ ] Removing using an index number

ATTENTION: Here the emphasis is on group work.
Each person in the group must commit something.
The program will be further developed in the future.
Now the most important thing is to organize yourself, divide your work and commit to a shared repository.
Remember about MVP (Minimal Viable Product).
